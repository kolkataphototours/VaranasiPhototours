    feeling: 'Shivam led and hosted us through a multi-day photographic expedition in Varanasi in February 2023. I’ve been to Varanasi a couple of times before, but the photographic activities and opportunities organised by Shivam delved deeper into the heartbeat of this holy ancient city and  provided us with amazing experiences as both photographers and travellers. We sailed on the Ganges at sunrise at sunset, with local boatmen and sadhus, we meandered through the back alleys and lanes, capturing life and light as they unfolded before us. Shivam’s knowledge of Varanasi’s old city is second to none and comes from someone who is intimately familiar with the place. I would heartily recommend Shivam as your photographic guide, mentor and fixer if you plan on visiting Varanasi. He is a 5-star experience!

They effortlessly arranged everything, allowing us to capture the tribes we desired in the most incredible way possible. The results were some of the best photos I have ever taken. I wholeheartedly commend their exceptional work and unwavering dedication. When it comes to photography fixer jobs in India, you can trust them without a doubt.',

    feeling: 'Despite having visited Varanasi before, Shivam’s meticulous organization of photographic activities and opportunities allowed us to delve even deeper into the soul of this ancient and sacred city, creating truly incredible experiences for both photographers and travellers. We sailed on the Ganges at sunrise and sunset, accompanied by local boatmen and sadhus, capturing mesmerizing moments of life and light unfolding before our lenses. Shivam’s unparalleled knowledge of Varanasi’s old city, combined with his intimate familiarity with the place, made him an exceptional guide, mentor, and fixer. If you plan on visiting Varanasi, I wholeheartedly recommend Shivam for a 5-star photographic experience that will leave you in awe.',

    feeling: 'Shubham’s enthusiasm & engagement was infectious and I was very comfortable with him. He then guided me through the narrow lanes & by lanes and streets where every other corner had a story to tell. Rickshaw pullers, yellow ambassador taxis, ageing doorframes, and interesting passers-by, all provide a rich tapestry of subjects for my lens. Thanks to Shubham, his expert knowledge, and his warm & friendly demeanour, I had a wonderful time during the photo walk. He was sweet enough to take BTS shots & videos while I was clicking photos & he made nice footage of them. I would highly recommend this Photowalk to anyone seeking to discover the true colours of this city in an authentic way.',

    feeling: 'I always like to hang out with a local and when I contacted them they were sweet enough to give me a photo tour for a day only as I had limited time. Shubham was such an amazing storyteller and a great guy to walk around as he make us understand everything you wanna know about India and its culture in the best manner. I am already looking forward to booking them again and enjoying my time travelling to India with Shubham or Shivam.',

    feeling: 'Shivam and Shubham are nothing short of brilliant when it came to assisting me around India. He knows the area very well. He had great suggestions on where to go and was able to take me to places that are out of the way and places that you just never thought of for photography. I love the way they communicated with the people and the people whose portraits I wanted to photograph. They are able to build rapport quickly. The best thing is that they are very respectful of the people that I wanted to photograph and make them feel comfortable as locals by communicating the right things. Definitely a recommendation for your go-to person in India for photography tours and projects.',
