Let me tell you, Shivam’s photography workshop is an absolute gem.The way he has designed it isnothing short of brilliant. His belief in learning while travelling truly resonates throughout the workshop, and you’ll find yourself gaining invaluable skills while immersing in the beauty of India.Shubham’s generosity shone through right from the start as he graciously picked us up from the airport. From that moment onwards, he proved to be an attentive and accommodating guide, always attuned to our preferences and making adjustments accordingly.
